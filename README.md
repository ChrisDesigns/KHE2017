# Hecking Passwords

Passwords are so easy to forget and often can be forget. So we've gotten to thinking, what last forever? Ofcourse, the answer is files! Hecking passwords does the following:

 * an user enters their username
 * uploads their file
 * the server verifies the hash-sum (which is unquie for each file)
 * Then redirects the user accordingly

### What is still to come?
This project was a quick response to the failure with working with CosmosOS. So it was done very quickly. However, we do end up working on it. So what can be expected?:
* Facial recognition (using point of reference)
* Password vault system
* Improved design
